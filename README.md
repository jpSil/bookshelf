# Bookshelf

Bookshelf is a CLI application for storing information about books you have read and want to read.

## Description

Bookshelf is a simple way to store information about any books you have read, <br/>
or would like to read. You can add and remove books, or modify existing entries, <br/>
and list all the books you have in your bookshelf.

## Getting Started

Bookshelf uses a sqlite database file for storing information. <br/>
At this point, the application does not create it for the user, so you have to create it manually.

The database schema is very simply and is shown in the image below.
